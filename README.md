# **My Personal Project**

## **Project Proposal** 

QuantEdge is a comprehensive investment tracking, visualization, and analysis platform designed to help users manage their stock portfolios with ease. The app allows investors to add stock purchases, generate detailed charts for asset allocation and market trends, and run predictive models to forecast future stock prices.

Targeted primarily at investors seeking a free yet reliable tool, QuantEdge provides essential features for tracking and analyzing investment performance.

This project holds special significance to me, as Iâ€™ve been passionate about trading from a young age. QuantEdge combines my interest in financial markets with the power of data-driven techniques like quantitative trading to offer valuable insights for investors.

## **User Stories**

### *Phase One*: 

- **Add a Stock for the first time:**
As a user, I would like to purchase stock (X) and add it to my portfolio (Y), specifying the stock ticker, price per stock, and the number of stocks purchased.

- **Buy Shares of Existing Stocks:**
As a user, I would like to re-purchase any stock (X) from portfolio (Y), specifying the stock ticker, price per stock, and the number of stocks. 

This would update my stock (X) with a new Average Price per share and number of shares owned.

- **View Portfolio:**
As a user, I would like to view the list of stocks I currently hold in my portfolio, along with total value of holdings.

- **View Stock Details:**
As a user, I should be able to select a specific stock from my portfolio and view details such as the number of shares I own and the purchase price.

- **Sell Stock:**
As a user, I should be able to sell any number of shares from a particular stock in my portfolio, and my portfolio should update to reflect the sale and remaining shares.


#### *Phase Two*:

- **Save Portfolio to a file:**
As a user, when I 'quit' the application, I would like the option to save my Portfolio to a file. This save would include all my stocks, along with all the information about the stocks such as Average price. 

- **Load Portfolio from a file:**
As a user, when I open QuantEdge, I would like to be asked if I want to open a previously saved Portfolio from file.
